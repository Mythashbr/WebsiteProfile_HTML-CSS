        <h2>Definition or Understanding of Hobby, namely activities that are carried out regularly, and are carried out by pleasure. Usually, this activity is done during free time. Hobbies can include many things, such as: collecting objects, getting involved in creative and artistic activities, playing sports, and many other examples. When a person continues to participate in a particular hobby, he will usually acquire substantial skills and knowledge in that area. In general, individuals who perform activities solely for fun are called amateurs, which are the opposite of a professional. Where he does an activity to get or get rewarded. An amateur, perhaps as skilled as a professional, is just that there are a few different principles. And the most basic of these principles is that a professional receives compensation for the activities he does, whereas an amateur does not.</h2>
        <h3>This is my hobby, I like movies, if there is a film released I can watch it until I forget the time on the day off, I like Korean dramas and movies, especially films with the action genre and comedy romance, one of the films that is still my favorite is the drama played by Song Joong Ki in 2016 entitled Descendant of the sun with Song Hye Kyo, then I also like cooking, especially cooking cakes, because in my opinion cooking can make my mood go up, and lastly I also often open social media especially in Nowadays social media is a place for us to get information, I also often play TikTok, maybe many people say TikTok is "Alay" but I ignore words like that, because with TikTok I can increase my daily income, and I am very grateful for that</h3>
